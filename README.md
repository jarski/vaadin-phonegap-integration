vaadin-phonegap-integration
===========================

This is a demo project to integrate Vaadin and PhoneGap

- config.xml: the configuration file for PhoneGap
- index.html: the html page which PhoneGap renders in native app
- ExampleApp: example Vaadin application which is wrapped by PhoneGap (This can be exluded from the PhoneGap project)
- VAADIN: static resources (widgetsets, theme) which is bundled with the PhoneGap

Another approach to do the integration was also tried. There is still some files related to that but those can be ignored at the moment.
- config_externalURL: configuration file where index.html file is external 
- ExampleApp/WebContent/www: PhoneGap project build for Android
